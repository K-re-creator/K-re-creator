# 🚀 About Me

🔥 I build stuff that matters. McRash Deliveries? Done. But I’m just getting started.

🌱 I’m all about learning full-stack dev, mastering MERN, and turning ideas into real projects.

👀 I love coding, designing systems, and seeing them actually work.

💭 My goal: build tech that makes life easier, from web apps to full digital solutions.

❤️ I’m also chasing self-growth, freedom, and the kind of success that lets me live on my own terms.

📫 Hit me up at koziresy11@gmail.com if you want to collab or talk tech.
